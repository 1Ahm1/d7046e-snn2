    "# 1 Synaptic plasticity  and learning in SNN â€“ D7046E @ LTU.SE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last updated 2024-02-01**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be optimized with gradient based learning using the back-propagation algorithm, which you are familiar with from the first ANN exercise. [snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) and [SpyTorch](https://github.com/fzenke/spytorch) are two examples of machine learning libraries that can be used to implement and train time-discretized SNNs with back-prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not how brains function. The flexible adaptation and learning capabilities of brains emerge from plasticity mechanisms at the synapse and neuron level that are essentialy *local*, in combination with network architectures featuring sparse long-range connections that have evolved to make the networks adapt in a useful way via plasticity (you can learn more about this in D7064E). This means that the adaptation of neurons and synapses mainly depend on the relative timing and statistics of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. This concept is called *spike timing dependent plasticity* (STDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will perform simulation experiments with the STDP learning rule for excitatory synapses introduced in the lectures. The particular STDP model that you will investigate is desceribed in [Neuronal Dynamics, 19.2.2 Pair-based Models of STDP](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch19.S2.html). Observe that this model does not apply to inhibitory synapses, which have constant weights in this exercise. You will also use the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of spiking neurons that you are familiar with from the first SNN exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![STDP model](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x596.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the pair-based STDP model is illustrated in the figure above. A synapse on a neuron receives a presynaptic spike at time $t^f_i$ and the neuron fires a postsynaptic spike at $t^f_j$. When this happens, the weight of the synapse changes by a relative amount $\\Delta w_{ij}/w_{ij}$ that depends on the relative timing of spikes, $t^f_j-t^f_i$, as illustrated by the experimental results in the figure. The rationale of this is quite:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the presynaptic spike happens just before the postsynaptic spike there is a cause and effect (causality). The synapse contributes to firing of a spike. In this case the synapse weight is increased (strengthened).\n",
    "- If the presynaptic spike happens just after the postsynaptic spike the latter was fired due to inputs on other synapses and there is *no causal effect*. In this case the synapse weight is decreased (weakened), but not below zero since it remains an excitatory synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, correlation-based learning of this type is called [Hebbian Learning](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch19.S1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The local nature of STDP is key for high energy efficiency. The long-range propagation of derivatives in backpropagation is costly. These aspects have important [carbon emission and environmental consequences](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem). Neuromorphic computing based on SNNs and STDP [offer an interesting alternative](https://tube.switch.ch/videos/db393d1d)."

    "In this exercise you have considered a tiny network of two neurons. In the paper considered as inspiration for this exercise the accuracy on the test set increases with the number of excitatory neurons in the population:\n",

    "An interesting aspect is that the STDP learning rule is a local rule that does not depend on global gradients. The training protocol is also unsupervised up to the point where the activities of different neuron populations are linked to class labels. Tnus, this SNN solves an unsupervised clustering task. After clustering the inputs, a class label can be associated with neurons that are activated for one specific digit. The activity of the subset/population of neurons that tend to fire for one particular input class determine which class the input belongs to.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is more to learn about how different spike codes and learning architectures can be further developed to improve on these results, see for example: [Deep Learning With Spiking Neurons: Opportunities and Challenges](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00774)"
